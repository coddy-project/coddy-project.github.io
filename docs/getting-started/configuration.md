# Configuration Reference

This page is the narrative guide. Two companion artifacts cover the full key list:

- **[config-reference.md](../reference/config.md)** - field-by-field tables: type, default, env-var fallback, required/optional, examples.
- **[config.schema.json](https://github.com/coddy-project/coddy-agent/blob/main/internal/config/config.schema.json)** - JSON Schema (draft-07) for editor autocomplete and validation, published at **https://coddy.dev/config.schema.json** so an editor resolves it without a checkout, and embedded into the binary so `coddy -t` checks a file against the same document (see [Checking the file from the command line](#checking-the-file-from-the-command-line)). Any editor with a YAML language server (VS Code YAML extension, Zed, Neovim, Helix) validates keys and values as you type once the file carries this header line:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coddy.dev/config.schema.json
```

**Coddy writes that line itself.** Every save that rewrites `config.yaml` - the settings screen (`PUT /coddy/config`), `coddy mcp add`, a skill source, the agent's own `config_set` / `config_commit` - adds the header when the file has none, and leaves a `$schema` you chose yourself (a pinned tag, a local path) alone. The same saves keep your comments, including commented-out keys, and the order the keys are already in; only the values change. JetBrains IDEs do not read the header; if `config.yaml` is not validated there, map the same URL by hand under **Settings - Languages & Frameworks - Schemas and DTDs - JSON Schema Mappings**. VS Code can be told the same thing without touching the file:

```json
"yaml.schemas": { "https://coddy.dev/config.schema.json": ["**/.coddy/config.yaml"] }
```

The schema is kept in sync with the Go config structs by `TestDocsConfigSchemaMatchesStructs` (`internal/config/docs_schema_test.go`); CI fails when a config field is added or renamed without updating the schema. The copy served from `coddy.dev` is a verbatim mirror of this file, kept in the [site repository](https://github.com/coddy-project/coddy-project.github.io).

## Config File Location and Paths

Resolved locations use environment variables and flags (see README). In short:

- **`CODDY_HOME`** - agent state directory. Default **`~/.coddy`**. Holds `config.yaml`, `sessions/`, `skills/`, Coddy-managed provider credentials under `providers/`, and **`scheduler/`** when using the optional cron scheduler.
- **`CODDY_CWD`** - default filesystem cwd when `session/new` sends an empty `cwd`. Default is the process working directory at startup. Same meaning as the **`--cwd`** flag when set.
- **`CODDY_CONFIG`** - explicit path to `config.yaml`. Same as **`--config`**.
- **`CODEX_HOME`** - Codex CLI state directory read by **`type: codex`** providers when no Coddy-managed credential exists. Default **`~/.codex`**.
- **`CODDY_CODEX_BASE_URL`** - override for the Codex backend endpoint (default **`https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`**). Process-level on purpose: **`api_base`** stays ignored for **`type: codex`**, so a settings document cannot redirect a ChatGPT OAuth token. Used by the executable specs and by self-hosted Codex gateways.

If no **`--config`** is given, the loader uses **`$CODDY_HOME/config.yaml`** (default home **`~/.coddy`**). If that file is missing, it tries **`config.yaml`** in the process current working directory (**`$CWD`** at startup). If neither file exists, built-in defaults apply (no error).

When the primary file exists but is invalid (YAML parse or validation error), the loader automatically recovers from **`config.yaml.bak`** in the same directory (see **`internal/config/recovery.go`**). After every successful load the server writes **`config.yaml.bak`**. The HTTP **`PUT /coddy/config`** route (see **`docs/reference/http-api.md`**) also snapshots the current file to **`config.yaml.bak`** before overwriting, so a failed reload can be rolled back.

The `coddy acp` subcommand also accepts **`--home`** (override `CODDY_HOME`), **`--sessions-dir`**, and **`--session-id`**. Optional **`sessions.dir`** in the YAML overrides the sessions root when **`--sessions-dir`** is not set (default **`$CODDY_HOME/sessions`**).

## Checking the file from the command line

Every command that loads `config.yaml` also takes `-t` (long form `--test-config`): bare `coddy -t`, `coddy cli -t`, `coddy acp -t` and `coddy serve -t`. The flag checks the file that command would load - `--config PATH` and `--home DIR` pick it exactly as they do for a start, `~/.coddy/.env` is loaded and `${VAR}` references are expanded first - and exits without starting anything. It never writes: the recovery from `config.yaml.bak` that a normal load performs on a broken file (see above) does not run, so the file you are told about is the file on disk. The flag works in every build, the lean one without the `cli` tag included.

The check has two stages. First the document is validated against the JSON Schema above, the same one editors use, embedded into the binary. This is what catches the mistakes the loader accepts silently: `config.yaml` is decoded leniently, so an unknown or misspelled key (`enabled` for `enable`) is ignored rather than rejected, and a value of the wrong shape, a value outside an enum or a range, a missing required key or a duplicate key surfaces later as odd behaviour. Then the loader's own rules run on the parsed document: a model naming a provider that does not exist, a `file` output without `logger.file`, `agent.model` missing from `models`. Every problem is printed as `file:line:column: what is wrong`, with an indented `fix:` line saying how to correct it and, where the schema has one, a `doc:` line carrying the field's description:

```text
$ coddy serve -t
/home/me/.coddy/config.yaml:13:3: httpserver.enabled: unknown key "enabled" (the loader ignores it, so it has no effect)
    fix: did you mean "enable"? keys allowed under httpserver: allow_insecure, auth_token, cors, enable, host, port, public_docs, remotes
    doc: Serve the HTTP API (and the embedded SPA) in this process. Omitted means true; set false on a node that only polls a messenger or relays a swarm.
/home/me/.coddy/config.yaml:16:10: logger.level: "verbose" is not an allowed value
    fix: use one of debug, info, warn, warning, error
    doc: Minimum severity written to the configured outputs ("warning" is accepted as an alias of "warn").
/home/me/.coddy/config.yaml:18:11: warning: subagents.enable: "yes" is read as the boolean true, but the schema and editors expect true or false
    fix: write enable: true (true or false, unquoted)
/home/me/.coddy/config.yaml: 2 errors, 1 warning
config test failed
```

The exit status is 1 when the file has errors and 0 otherwise, so the flag fits a deploy script right before `coddy serve restart`. Warnings (marked `warning:`) never fail the check: they flag spellings the loader still reads but the schema and editors reject - `yes` for a boolean, `40.0` for an integer - and a file without the `# yaml-language-server:` header. A missing file is an error, since the flag exists to check the file a start would use. Values under secret-shaped keys (`api_key`, `auth_token`, `pairing_tokens`) are never echoed in a message.

## Dry run: probing what the file points at

`--dry-run` looks at the world the file describes, after the same check `--test-config` performs. Every command that takes `-t` takes it too: `coddy --dry-run`, `coddy cli --dry-run`, `coddy acp --dry-run`, `coddy serve --dry-run`, with `--config` and `--home` selecting the file as for a start. The static check runs first, and a file with errors stops there - probing what a broken file names would only bury the first mistake under its consequences. When the file is clean, the configuration is loaded without side effects (no `config.yaml.bak` written or restored) and probed:

- **paths** - `sessions.dir`, `logger.file`, `scheduler.dir` and `memory.dir` are fine when missing as long as they can be created (the process makes them at start), and an error when a regular file stands in the way; `prompts.dir` has to exist, and a template missing from it is a warning; `skills.dirs`, `subagents.dirs` and `hooks.files` entries you wrote are warnings when missing, while absent defaults stay quiet; a hook file that exists has to parse; `swarm.tls` must load and every `dial.ca_file` must hold a certificate;
- **LLM providers** - each provider is asked for its model list, which exercises the address, the proxy and the credential in one request (`coddy providers login` credentials included); a provider aimed at a vendor's official endpoint with nothing to present is reported without a request. Every `models[]` entry is then checked against that list: a model the server does not name is a warning, since some servers serve more than they list;
- **MCP servers** from `config.yaml` - the executable of a stdio server is resolved in `PATH` the way the spawn would, without spawning it; a remote server is asked for any HTTP answer, with its headers. Project-local `.coddy/mcp.json` declarations are not contacted: they sit behind the workspace trust gate;
- **Telegram** - when `gateways.telegram.enable` is true the token is checked against the Bot API (`getMe`), through `gateways.telegram.proxy` when set; the report names the bot;
- **remotes** - each `httpserver.remotes[]` URL is asked for an answer (a warning when down, since it is used only on request), and the `--remote` target of a console or `acp` run has to accept the token;
- **`coddy serve` only** - the subsystems the configuration and the typed flags enable are resolved as a start would (a surface this binary was not built with is an error, not a silent skip), each listen address is bound once and released, so a port another process holds is named together with the line that set it, and the relays in `swarm.join` and the upstreams a relay mounts are reached through their dial settings.

On its own the flag is quiet: it prints the problems - each `warning` and `error` with the place in the file and the fix - and one status line at the end, so a healthy setup answers with that line alone and a deploy script has one thing to read:

```text
$ coddy --dry-run
dry run: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 4 ok
```

When something is off, the problems come first and the status line still closes the report; the exit status is 1 and the last line says `dry run failed`:

```text
$ coddy --dry-run

         fix: check api_base and that the server is running
dry run: 2 errors, 3 warnings, 4 ok

```

Add `--test-config` to see the whole picture: the config check report first (the same one `-t` prints, `valid` included), then every probe, the ones that passed too, so the report shows what was actually tried and against which address:

```text
$ coddy --dry-run --test-config

```

`ok` and `skipped` lines carry no fix; a `warning` never fails the run; an `error` does. A file that fails the static check is always shown, whichever flags were given: nothing else can be probed until it is fixed. Network probes run concurrently and each is bounded to ten seconds, so a dead server costs one wait, not one per model. Secrets are not echoed: a Telegram token is masked in any error text and a provider key is never printed. `CODDY_TELEGRAM_API_BASE` points the Telegram probe at a stand-in Bot API (tests and self-hosted gateways).

## Full Configuration Schema

Agent name, title, and build version are not configurable here. They are fixed in the binary and reported during ACP `initialize` (`internal/acp` and `internal/version`).

```yaml
# LLM backends (Go: []config.ProviderConfig, internal/config/providers.go)
# Each providers[].name must match ^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*$ (ASCII letter first, then letters, digits, hyphen, underscore).
# api_key may be a literal, "${ENV}" expanded when the file loads, or empty to read NAME_API_KEY at LLM call time
# (NAME is the provider name in uppercase with hyphens mapped to underscores, for example rpa -> RPA_API_KEY).
# api_key_command (optional): when api_key is empty, this command is run via the detected host shell and its trimmed stdout is
# used as the key (credential helper, like git/docker helpers or AWS credential_process). It lets a provider fetch
# short-lived or login-issued keys without storing a static secret. On failure resolution falls back to NAME_API_KEY.
# Resolution order: literal api_key -> api_key_command stdout -> NAME_API_KEY env.

```

ACP flags override the same knobs when set: **`--log-level`**, **`--log-output`** (stdout, stderr, file, both), **`--log-file`**, **`--log-format`**. Empty flag values keep the YAML (or built-in) defaults. **`--log-level`** also takes the per-component spec as a comma-separated list (**`--log-level "info,gateway.telegram=debug"`**); a bare level leaves the configured **`levels`** entries alone, and a spec that names components replaces them.

If the older two-field style had **`file`** set under **`logger`** but no **`outputs`**, the loader expands to **`stderr`** plus **`file`** so file logging takes effect.

## SSH remote execution

The built-in `ssh_run_command` tool lets the agent run commands on remote hosts over SSH — no external `ssh` binary required (pure-Go via `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`). The only configurable knob is `tools.ssh_connect_timeout` (TCP dial timeout, default 30 s).

**Authentication order:**
1. **SSH agent** — if `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is set and reachable, the agent is used first. This covers YubiKeys, 1Password SSH agent, gpg-agent, and standard `ssh-agent` setups.
2. **Key files** — Coddy always looks in the current OS user's `~/.ssh` directory. Key names tried in order: `id_ed25519`, `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_dsa`. Keys protected by a passphrase are silently skipped.

Both sources are active simultaneously — if the agent is available and has keys, files still act as a fallback if the agent declines.

**Host key verification** — derived automatically from `tools.permission_mode`:
- Any mode except `bypass` **(default)** — new hosts are added to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` automatically on first connect (TOFU); if a known host's key has changed, the old entry is replaced with the new one.
- `bypass` — host key verification is disabled (suitable for ephemeral VMs or CI environments).

**Tool schema** — `ssh_run_command` accepts:
| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `host` | string | yes | `user@hostname` — user is required |
| `command` | string | yes | Shell command to run on the remote host |
| `port` | integer | no | SSH port (default: 22) |
| `timeout_seconds` | integer | no | Command timeout in seconds |
| `permission_rationale` | string | no | Text shown in the permission dialog |

The tool requires user permission (same as `run_command`) and returns combined stdout + stderr.

## HTTP gateway (optional build)

The **`httpserver`** key (`config.HTTPServerConfig` in `internal/config/http.go`) is ignored unless you use a binary built with **`-tags http`**. It sets default **`host`** and **`port`** when **`coddy serve`** is still at the built-in flag defaults (`0.0.0.0` and `12345`). See **`docs/reference/http-api.md`**.

## Scheduler (optional build)

### MCP project trust

The **`mcp.project_trust`** key decides whether the project-local **`<workspace>/.coddy/mcp.json`** may start
its servers: **`ask`** (default) holds them until the operator approves each declaration for that workspace,
**`allow`** starts them automatically, **`deny`** never loads them. Pass **`coddy acp --mcp-project-trust <value>`**
or **`coddy serve --mcp-project-trust <value>`** to override it for one process, which is what CI jobs and
container entrypoints use instead of editing the config file. An unknown value fails the launch.
Added for [issue #80](https://github.com/coddy-project/coddy-agent/issues/80); full guide in
[docs/features/mcp.md](../features/mcp.md).

The **`scheduler`** key (`config.SchedulerConfig` in `internal/config/scheduler.go`) is used only when you build with **`-tags scheduler`**. Set **`scheduler.enable: true`** in YAML or pass **`coddy acp -scheduler`** / **`coddy serve -scheduler`** to set **`scheduler.enable`** for that process without editing the config file.

Jobs are flat **`*.md`** files under **`scheduler.dir`** (default **`${CODDY_HOME}/scheduler`** when **`dir`** is empty). Each file has YAML frontmatter with **`description`**, **`schedule`** (five cron fields, **UTC**), optional **`cwd`** (defaults to the directory where **`coddy`** was started), **`model`**, **`mode`** (`agent`, `plan`, or `ask`), optional **`paused`** (when true, cron and manual run are skipped until resume). The markdown body is the one-shot instruction for the sub-agent. Sidecars **`basename.state`** (last fired slot) and **`basename.lock`** (run in progress) sit next to **`basename.md`**.

**`retain_sessions`** (default **5**) caps how many **completed** scheduler-run session directories are kept per **`job_id`** under **`sessions.dir`**; older runs are pruned.

When the scheduler is effectively enabled, **`coddy_scheduler_*`** tools cover list or get, create or replace or patch, delete, pause or resume, manual run, cancel, and listing run metadata (**`coddy_scheduler_jobs_list`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_get`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_create`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_replace`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_patch`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_delete`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_pause`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_resume`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_run`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_cancel`**, **`coddy_scheduler_job_runs`**). With **`-tags=http,scheduler`**, the same operations exist as REST under **`/coddy/scheduler`** (see **`docs/reference/http-api.md`**).

## Messenger Gateway (`gateways`)

Requires a binary built with **`-tags gateway.telegram`** (Telegram only) or **`-tags gateway`** (all adapters). The `coddy serve` subcommand reads this block.

```yaml
# Messenger gateways (external/gateway/; build with -tags gateway.telegram or -tags gateway).
# Full guide: docs/surfaces/gateway.md
gateways:
  telegram:
    # Set to true to activate the Telegram adapter when coddy serve starts.
    enable: false

    # Bot token from @BotFather. Never hard-code; always use an env reference.
    token: "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}"

    # Optional outbound proxy for Telegram API requests (http, https, socks5, socks5h).
    # proxy: "socks5h://127.0.0.1:1080"

    # Telegram user IDs with admin privileges.
    # Admins bypass every access check and can always interact with the bot.
    admins: []
    # Example:
    # admins: [98874093]

    # Default access level for chats without a per-chat override.
    #   "all"          - anyone who can write to the chat
    #   "admins"       - only user IDs listed in admins
    #   "group:<name>" - only users in the named user_groups entry (admins always pass)
    default_access: "all"

    # Default session isolation mode for group chats without a per-chat override.
    #   "individual"   - each group member gets their own session
    #   "shared"       - all members share one session
    #   "admin"        - only admins can interact; all admins share one session
    default_isolation: "individual"

    # Named sets of user IDs for group-based access control.
    user_groups: []
    # Example:
    # user_groups:
    #   - name: "devs"
    #     user_ids: [111222333, 444555666]

    # Per-chat overrides. chat_id is negative for groups and supergroups.
    chats: []
    # Example:
    # chats:
    #   - chat_id: -1001234567890
    #     isolation: "individual"
    #     access: "all"
    #   - chat_id: -1009876543210
    #     isolation: "admin"
    #     access: "admins"
```

`token` is validated at startup when `enable: true`. `proxy` is optional (empty = direct connection). The other fields apply defaults if omitted: `default_access: "all"`, `default_isolation: "individual"`.

See **[docs/surfaces/gateway.md](../surfaces/gateway.md)** for the full configuration guide, running instructions, and how to add adapters for other messengers.

## `.env` file

If **`$CODDY_HOME/.env`** exists, it is read at startup **before** `config.yaml` is parsed. This lets you keep all secrets in one place without touching shell profiles or Docker compose environment blocks.

```sh
# ~/.coddy/.env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=8992982910:AAF...
```

Then in `config.yaml` reference them as usual:

```yaml
providers:
  - name: openai
    type: openai
    api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
```

**Rules:**

- Variables that are **already set** in the process environment are **never overridden** — the process environment always wins. `.env` is a fallback only.
- A missing `.env` is silently ignored (not an error).
- The file is resolved relative to the effective `CODDY_HOME` (`~/.coddy` by default, or the path from `--home` / `CODDY_HOME` env var).

**Supported syntax:**

| Line form | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| `KEY=value` | `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-abc` |
| `export KEY=value` | `export DEBUG=true` |
| Double-quoted value | `MSG="hello world"` |
| Single-quoted value | `PATH='no escape \n here'` |
| Escape sequences in `"…"` | `NOTE="line1\nline2"` → real newline |
| Inline comment (unquoted) | `KEY=val # this is ignored` |
| Comment line | `# full-line comment` |

Values already in the process environment (e.g. set by the shell, Docker, systemd) take priority and are never changed by `.env`.

## Environment Variable References

Any config value can reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax.
The agent resolves these at startup.

**Literal `$` in a value:** because expansion runs over the raw file, a value that must contain a
literal dollar sign (e.g. a proxy or API-key secret like `$2y$10$…`) has to double it as `$$` — `$$`
expands back to a single `$`, exactly like docker-compose / envsubst. Without this, fragments such as
`$2y` or `$10` are treated as environment-variable references and resolve to empty strings, silently
corrupting the secret. The Settings UI does this automatically for the `proxy` fields
(`providers[].proxy` and `gateways.telegram.proxy`), which are always treated as literal URLs and do
**not** support `${VAR}` references; for a literal `$` in `api_key` (which does support `${VAR}`),
write `$$` by hand.

Two placeholders are not environment variables:

- **`${CODDY_HOME}`** - the resolved `CODDY_HOME` directory, substituted when the file is read.
- **`${CWD}`** - the **session** working directory. It is **not** substituted when the file is read: it stays in the loaded value and whatever uses the path expands it against the session that asks - skill loading, subagent and hook discovery, prompt templates (**`prompts.dir`**), MCP server command, arguments, URL, environment and headers. One **`coddy serve`** process therefore serves many workspaces, and a session rooted in a project sees that project's **`${CWD}/.coddy/skills`** (or any entry you write, such as **`${CWD}/.agents/skills`**) regardless of the directory the server was started from. Only the process-scoped locations (**`sessions.dir`**, **`scheduler.dir`**, **`memory.dir`**, **`logger.file`**) expand **`${CWD}`** against the default working directory (**`CODDY_CWD`**) at load time, since no session owns them.

An environment variable named **`CWD`** does not replace the placeholder (a bare **`$CWD`** without braces is still an ordinary environment reference, as before), and **`GET /coddy/config`**, the Settings UI, and **`config_get`** report the entry exactly as written. The placeholder is honoured only in the fields listed above; in any other string value it stays as written (prompt templates use **`{{.CWD}}`** instead). Releases up to 1.0.5 substituted **`${CWD}`** with the process directory when the file was read, so a Settings save made in that version may have stored an absolute path such as **`/home/you/.agents/skills`** where you wrote **`${CWD}/.agents/skills`**; put the placeholder back by hand to get per-session resolution.

## Model Provider Reference

Provider **`type`** values match **`internal/llm.NewProvider`**: **`openai`**, **`anthropic`**, **`neuraldeep`**.

YAML split:

- **`providers`**: **`name`** (unique), **`type`**, **`api_key`**, optional **`api_base`** (base URL override for the provider SDK: an OpenAI-compatible endpoint or Ollama host without **`/v1`** for **`type: openai`**, or an Anthropic-compatible gateway/relay for **`type: anthropic`**; for **`type: neuraldeep`** it selects the deployment, **`https://api.neuraldeep.ru/v1`** or **`https://api.neuraldeep.tech/v1`**, and any other value falls back to the first), optional **`proxy`** (per-provider outbound **`http://`**, **`https://`**, **`socks5://`**, or **`socks5h://`** URL; not a global default), optional **`usage_limits_panel`** (boolean, default **`true`**; **`false`** hides the account usage panel of this row on every surface and stops the usage reads behind it, meaningful for **`type: neuraldeep`** today).
- **`models`**: **`model`** (string **`provider_name/api_model_id`**, session selector and **`agent.model`** value; first segment names **`providers[].name`**, remainder is the API model id), **`max_tokens`**, **`temperature`**, optional **`max_context_tokens`** (UI hint for context bar; 0 means derive from provider metadata), optional **`multimodal`** (boolean, default **`false`**; when **`true`** signals that the model accepts image/file inputs — the UI exposes a file attachment button in the composer for this model only), optional **`reasoning_levels`** (string list; overrides the reasoning levels offered for this model — when omitted they are auto-detected from the API model id: **`gpt-5*`** and **`gpt-6*`** → **`minimal,low,medium,high`**, OpenAI **`o`**-series, **`gpt-oss*`**, **`qwen3*`** (qwen3, qwen3.5, qwen3.6, qwen3.8, ...) and Claude extended-thinking models → **`low,medium,high`**; an explicit empty list hides the composer reasoning selector), optional **`reasoning_default`** (the level pre-selected for new chats; must be one of the resolved levels). Reasoning levels map to OpenAI **`reasoning_effort`** and Anthropic extended-thinking **`budget_tokens`**; for **`qwen3*`** models on OpenAI-compatible providers the request also carries **`chat_template_kwargs`** **`{"enable_thinking": true}`** so the chat-template thinking switch stays on. The Codex backend rejects **`max_output_tokens`**, so **`max_tokens`** is not sent for **`codex`** providers; it also rejects the **`minimal`** tier its **`gpt-5*`** and **`gpt-6*`** ids would normally imply, so codex-backed models offer **`none`** in its place (in the composer selector and in **`GET /v1/models`**). Reasoning turns request summaries (**`summary: auto`**) so thinking streams, and encrypted reasoning (**`include: reasoning.encrypted_content`**) so the chain of thought is replayed across tool calls the way the Codex CLI does it. See [config-reference.md](../reference/config.md) for token lifetime and the startup credential report.

### `openai`
Standard OpenAI API. Supports the current reasoning families (`gpt-6-astra`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5.5`) as well as the older `o`-series and `gpt-4` ids.

Provider needs **`api_key`**. Optional **`proxy`** applies only to this provider row (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS5, or SOCKS5h). The **`models[].model`** string must start with this provider **`name`** and a slash, then the OpenAI API model id, for example **`openai/gpt-5.6-terra`**. Also set **`max_tokens`**, and **`temperature`** for the non-reasoning ids.

### `anthropic`
Anthropic API. Supports: `claude-3-5-sonnet-*`, `claude-3-5-haiku-*`, `claude-3-opus-*`

Provider needs **`api_key`**. Optional **`api_base`** overrides the Anthropic API base URL (default **`https://api.anthropic.com`**), for example an Anthropic-compatible gateway or relay. Optional **`proxy`** applies only to this provider row. Use **`models[].model`** like **`anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`**, plus **`max_tokens`**, **`temperature`**.

### `neuraldeep`
NeuralDeep API via its OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Credentials come from either a hub sign-in or a plain key. **`coddy providers login neuraldeep`** signs in through the device flow: it prints a short code and the hub page that confirms it, so the browser can be on any machine - a laptop, a phone - while Coddy runs on a server reached over SSH. It opens that page for you when this machine has a browser of its own. **`--browser`** asks for the older loopback callback instead; that one only completes in a browser running on this machine. A login waits for the confirmation until the hub's fifteen-minute deadline, and Ctrl-C ends it sooner. Either way it stores the hub-issued key under **`$CODDY_HOME/providers/<name>/neuraldeep-auth.json`**, and appends the tier's models to the config; the bundled web UI offers **Sign In with NeuralDeep** on the provider row. An explicit **`api_key`** (or **`api_key_command`** / **`NEURALDEEP_API_KEY`**) always wins over the stored login.

While a `neuraldeep` model is active, the console footer, the remote console and the HTTP API show the account's usage (the hub's read-only **`GET /v1/limits`**: session and week windows as percent used with reset times, the wallet in rubles, a hit limit with its reset time), refreshed at session start and after every turn; see **`docs/surfaces/console.md`** (Footer, `/usage`) and **`docs/reference/http-api.md`** (**`GET /coddy/providers/{name}/usage`**). The row's own credential is used, and no dollar figure is ever shown. The panel is on by default; **`usage_limits_panel: false`** on the row (the **Usage limits panel** switch in Settings → LLM Providers) hides it on every surface and stops the **`GET /v1/limits`** reads for that row, for a shared screen or an account that is not yours to watch.

The same API is served from two deployments: **`https://api.neuraldeep.ru/v1`** for Russia and **`https://api.neuraldeep.tech/v1`** for everywhere else. **`api_base`** selects one - leave it empty for the first, and any value that is not one of the two falls back to it (a startup warning says so). The choice travels with the credential: sign-in goes to **`hub.neuraldeep.ru`** or **`hub.neuraldeep.tech`** to match, so pick the endpoint before signing in (**`coddy providers login neuraldeep --api-base https://api.neuraldeep.tech/v1`**, or the endpoint dropdown in Settings). A login with **`--api-base`** also moves an existing provider row to that endpoint (unless **`--no-config`**), so the row and the key agree; in Settings the sign-in follows the dropdown as picked in the form, before Save. A key minted by one hub is not honored by the other; Coddy warns at startup when the stored login and the selected endpoint disagree, and the Settings row shows the same warning live. **`CODDY_NEURALDEEP_BASE_URL`** and **`CODDY_NEURALDEEP_HUB_URL`** still redirect the whole process for stands and tests, and they win over the config. Optional **`proxy`** applies only to this provider row. Use **`models[].model`** like **`neuraldeep/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`**, plus **`max_tokens`**, **`temperature`**.

### Local OpenAI-compatible servers (Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio)
Use **`type: openai`** and set **`api_base`** to an OpenAI-compatible base URL that already includes **`/v1`**, for example **`http://localhost:11434/v1`** for Ollama.
