# `config.yaml` reference

Field-by-field reference for `~/.coddy/config.yaml`. For narrative documentation (file discovery, `.env`, provider guides) see [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md).

A machine-readable [JSON Schema](https://github.com/coddy-project/coddy-agent/blob/main/internal/config/config.schema.json) accompanies this reference, published at **https://coddy.dev/config.schema.json** and embedded into the binary, where `coddy -t` / `--test-config` checks a file against it from the command line (see [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md#checking-the-file-from-the-command-line)). Point your editor's YAML language server at it to get autocomplete and typo checking:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coddy.dev/config.schema.json
```

VS Code (with the YAML extension), Zed, Neovim and Helix pick this comment up automatically, and Coddy writes it into every `config.yaml` it saves (see [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md)); JetBrains IDEs do not read it and need the URL registered under **JSON Schema Mappings** instead. The schema is kept in sync with the Go config structs by `TestDocsConfigSchemaMatchesStructs` in `internal/config/docs_schema_test.go`. Optional tri-state fields (for example `compaction.enable`, `models[].stream`, `tools.output_limits.*`) accept `null` as well as a value: `null` means unset, and that is the form Coddy writes for everything you never set, so a saved config validates clean.

Every field is optional unless marked **required**; an empty `config.yaml` (or none at all) is valid and uses built-in defaults. Any string value may reference environment variables with `${VAR_NAME}` (expanded when the file is loaded). To keep a **literal `$`** in a value (e.g. a secret like `$2y$10$…`), double it as `$$` - the UI does this automatically for the `proxy` fields. `${CODDY_HOME}` is expanded by the loader; `${CWD}` stays in the loaded value and is expanded per session by whatever reads the path, except in the process-scoped `sessions.dir`, `scheduler.dir`, `memory.dir`, and `logger.file` (see [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md#environment-variable-references)).

## Agent self-configuration

Agent sessions expose a typed configuration tool family with staged, uci-like semantics:

- `config_get` reads a dotted path from the active YAML file. Secret-shaped fields (including `api_key_command`), MCP environment values, and HTTP header values are returned as `<redacted>`.
- `config_set` **stages** UCI-style commands (`set`, `add_list`, `del_list`, `delete`) without touching the file. Unknown schema paths and commands that would make the config invalid are rejected at staging time. Echoed command lists mask secret-shaped values as `<redacted>`; the staged store keeps the original values.
- `config_changes` lists the staged commands that a commit would apply (secrets redacted).
- `config_commit` applies the staged batch: validates, snapshots the previous file to `config.yaml.prev` (an empty document when the config file did not exist yet, so the first commit stays reversible), writes atomically, and hot-reloads skills, rules, built-in tools, and configured MCP servers. Because a commit can start MCP processes and change the permission policy itself, it prompts for tool permission in both `ask` and `accept_edits` modes - only `tools.permission_mode: bypass` skips the dialog - and the prompt lists the staged commands with secrets redacted. The agent is additionally instructed to ask the user to confirm saving first. If runtime reload fails, the file is restored and the staged commands are kept; if even that restore fails, the staged list stays consumed so a blind retry cannot replay it.
- `config_revert` discards staged commands (all of them, or those under one path).
- `config_rollback` restores the pre-commit snapshot over the active file (swapping the two, so a second rollback undoes the first) and hot-reloads. It carries the same permission policy as `config_commit`, and the agent warns the user before calling it.

Commands and paths are dotted like OpenWrt's `uci` CLI, with a selector for named sequence entries:

| Command | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `set agent.max_turns=40` | Set a mapping field |
| `set mcp_servers[name=context7]={"command":"npx"}` | Select a sequence object by scalar field; append it when setting if absent |
| `add_list skills.dirs=/opt/skills` | Append a sequence entry |
| `del_list skills.dirs=/opt/skills` | Remove a matching sequence entry |
| `delete mcp_servers[name=context7]` | Delete a field or entry |
| `skills.dirs.0` (path form) | Sequence index |

The root path (`.` or `/`) is read-only. Values are JSON for objects and arrays; string-typed fields take the literal text. Staged commands persist in the session bundle, so they survive restarts and HTTP permission resumes.

The bundled `/configure-coddy` skill teaches the agent this syntax, the confirm-then-commit workflow, and the safe discovery/install workflow for MCP servers and skills; it also carries the agent-facing catalog of configuration areas and must be updated together with this reference on any schema change. Process-level listener changes may still require restarting the relevant command; the hot reload is specifically guaranteed for the current session's agent configuration, skills, rules, built-in tools, and global MCP clients.

## Field reference

Generated from `internal/config/config.schema.json` (the schema embedded into the binary, published at <https://coddy.dev/config.schema.json>) and from the defaults the loader applies, by `make docs`; `make docs-check` fails when this block is stale. Types read as the schema declares them (`string or null` is a tri-state field), defaults are what an empty `config.yaml` resolves to, and the description is the `doc:` line `coddy -t` prints for the key. Notes that do not fit a table row follow in [Notes](#notes).

### `providers`

API credentials and transport selection for upstream LLM vendors. When api_key is empty, the runtime reads the NAME_API_KEY environment variable (NAME is the provider name in uppercase with hyphens mapped to underscores).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `providers` | list of objects |  | API credentials and transport selection for upstream LLM vendors. When api_key is empty, the runtime reads the NAME_API_KEY environment variable (NAME is the provider name in uppercase with hyphens mapped to underscores). |
| `providers[].name` | string |  | Logical id used as the first segment of models[].model. ASCII letters, digits, hyphen, underscore; must start with a letter. |
| `providers[].type` | string, one of `openai`, `anthropic`, `neuraldeep`, `codex` |  | Wire protocol for this provider. Use "openai" for configurable OpenAI-compatible endpoints (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Groq, Ollama, llama.cpp, LM Studio), "anthropic" for Anthropic, "neuraldeep" for NeuralDeep's OpenAI-compatible API at one of its two official deployments (selected with api_base), or "codex" for ChatGPT OAuth against the official Codex backend (Responses API). |
| `providers[].api_base` | string |  | Optional base URL override. For type "openai" include /v1 (e.g. http://localhost:11434/v1); for type "anthropic" an Anthropic-compatible gateway (default https://api.anthropic.com). For type "neuraldeep" it selects the deployment: https://api.neuraldeep.ru/v1 (Russia, the default) or https://api.neuraldeep.tech/v1 (the international mirror); any other value falls back to the default. Ignored for type "codex", which always uses a fixed official endpoint. |
| `providers[].api_key` | string |  | Provider secret. A literal key, a "${ENV}" reference expanded at load time, or empty to read NAME_API_KEY at LLM call time. Resolution order: api_key -> api_key_command stdout -> NAME_API_KEY. |
| `providers[].api_key_command` | string |  | Optional credential-helper command. When api_key is empty it runs via the detected host shell (pwsh, powershell, or cmd on Windows; bash or sh elsewhere) and the trimmed stdout is used as the key. On failure resolution falls back to NAME_API_KEY. |
| `providers[].proxy` | string |  | Optional per-provider outbound proxy URL: http://, https://, socks5://, or socks5h:// (socks5h resolves hostnames via the proxy). |
| `providers[].timeout_ms` | integer | 0 | Optional bound on each LLM HTTP request to this provider, including the streamed body read. 0 (the default) sets no client timeout, so slow prompt processing on large contexts is never cut short. |
| `providers[].usage_limits_panel` | boolean or null | true | Show this provider's account usage panel (the console footer line and /usage, the usage section and banner in the web UI) and read the provider's usage endpoint for it (GET /v1/limits for type neuraldeep). Omit or true keeps the panel on; false hides it and stops those reads for this row. Only providers whose type has a usage source are affected. |

### `models`

Named model entries the agent and UI can select.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `models` | list of objects |  | Named model entries the agent and UI can select. |
| `models[].model` | string |  | "provider_name/api_model_id": the first path segment must match a providers[].name; the remainder is sent to the LLM API (may itself contain slashes). |
| `models[].max_tokens` | integer |  | Upper bound on completion tokens per assistant message. Ignored by Codex because its backend does not accept max_output_tokens. |
| `models[].temperature` | number |  | Sampling temperature (0 = deterministic; higher = more random). |
| `models[].max_context_tokens` | integer | 0 | Optional UI hint for the composer context bar; 0 derives it from provider metadata when available. |
| `models[].multimodal` | boolean | false | Model accepts image/file inputs in addition to text; the UI shows a file attachment button for this model. |
| `models[].reasoning_levels` | list of strings or null |  | Override the reasoning levels offered for this model. Omit to auto-detect from the model id (gpt-5* -> minimal,low,medium,high; OpenAI o-series, gpt-oss*, qwen3*, and Claude extended-thinking models -> low,medium,high). An explicit empty list hides the selector. Settings fills this field from GET /coddy/config/reasoning-levels behind its Fetch reasoning levels button. |
| `models[].reasoning_default` | string |  | Reasoning level pre-selected for new chats; must be one of the resolved levels, otherwise ignored. |
| `models[].stream` | boolean or null | true | Transport used to talk to this model. Omit (or true) to stream over SSE. false issues one blocking completion request and delivers the whole answer at once, for servers or proxies that handle event streams badly. Rejected for providers of type codex, whose backend is streaming-only. |

### `agent`

Defaults for the main agent loop (model id and safety caps).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `agent.model` | string |  | Default models[].model id used until the client overrides the model per session. Required when models is non-empty. |
| `agent.max_turns` | integer | 30 | Hard cap on LLM calls per prompt turn. |
| `agent.max_tokens_per_turn` | integer | 200000 | Max tokens across all LLM calls in one turn. |
| `agent.llm_retry_max` | integer or null | 3 | Retries after retryable LLM errors such as HTTP 429. An explicit 0 disables retries. |
| `agent.llm_retry_base_ms` | integer | 1000 | Initial backoff between LLM retries, in milliseconds. A server-provided pause (Retry-After-Ms / Retry-After headers, "Limit resets at" / "retry in Ns" body phrases) overrides the exponential backoff, capped at 60s. |
| `agent.llm_min_interval_ms` | integer | 0 | Minimum gap between consecutive LLM calls in milliseconds, retry attempts included (0 disables pacing; e.g. 12000 on strict free tiers). |
| `agent.llm_first_token_timeout_ms` | integer or null | 90000 | How long a streamed LLM call may stay silent before the turn cancels it (the API hang guard). An explicit 0 disables the guard; blocking (stream: false) transports are never guarded. |
| `agent.loop_guard` | boolean or null | true | Runaway-loop protection: cut a streamed response that degenerates into repeating itself, and block a tool called over and over with identical arguments. |
| `agent.loop_tool_repeat_limit` | integer or null | 3 | Consecutive identical tool calls (same name, same canonical arguments) before the loop guard steps in. 0 disables the tool-repeat check. |
| `agent.loop_stream_repeat_cycles` | integer or null | 5 | Identical back-to-back output cycles inside one streamed response before the stream is cut. 0 disables the stream check. |
| `agent.loop_nudge_max` | integer or null | 2 | How many times one turn may be nudged back on track before the loop guard stops it with a notice. |
| `agent.wait_for_limit_reset` | boolean | false | Wait for a hit usage limit to lift and re-issue the call, instead of ending the turn with the provider's error. Applies to a top-level turn whose provider names a pause beyond the retry budget (a 429 with Retry-After or "Limit resets at"); the turn lock and the client stream stay open while it waits, so it is off by default. |
| `agent.wait_for_limit_reset_max_ms` | integer or null | 14400000 | Longest time one turn spends waiting for limits in total, in milliseconds, the retry wrapper's own sleeps on a limit included; a pause that would exceed it ends the turn at once with the error. An explicit 0 never waits. |

### `prompts`

Override the built-in system prompt templates (Go text/template).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `prompts.dir` | string | "" | Directory containing prompt template files. Empty uses embedded defaults. Supports ~ and ${CWD} (session cwd at render time). |
| `prompts.agent_prompt` | string | agent.md | File name inside prompts.dir for agent mode. |
| `prompts.plan_prompt` | string | plan.md | File name inside prompts.dir for plan mode. |
| `prompts.ask_prompt` | string | ask.md | File name inside prompts.dir for ask mode. |

### `instructions`

Files read from the session working directory and appended to the system prompt (AGENTS.md convention).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `instructions.files` | list of strings | ["AGENTS.md"] | Filenames relative to the session CWD. |

### `skills`

Directories scanned for skills (SKILL.md and root .md/.mdc files).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `skills.dirs` | list of strings | ["~/.agents/skills","${CODDY_HOME}/skills","${CWD}/.coddy/skills"] | Search paths; later entries win on name conflicts. Defaults (lowest to highest priority): ~/.agents/skills, ${CODDY_HOME}/skills, ${CWD}/.coddy/skills. ${CODDY_HOME} expands when the file is loaded; ${CWD} stays in the entry and expands per session against that session's workspace. |
| `skills.sources` | list of strings |  | Remote skill sources installed on demand with `coddy skills sync` (never fetched automatically). Each entry is a GitHub repo (owner/repo[@ref]), a git URL, or an http(s) URL to an agents-standard marketplace.json. Materialized into ${CODDY_HOME}/skills. |
| `skills.auto_discovery` | boolean or null | true | Offer the model-driven load_skill tool so the agent pulls a catalogued skill's full instructions into a turn on its own when the request matches, instead of requiring an explicit /name. Defaults to true. |

### `rules`

Discovery of rule files from .coddy/rules, .agents/rules, .cursor/rules, .claude/rules, .codex/rules and nested AGENTS.md under the session CWD; .mdc files are Cursor rules, .md files Claude Code rules. See https://coddy.dev/docs/features/rules.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `rules.auto_discover` | boolean or null | true | Scan the session CWD rule roots automatically. |
| `rules.systems` | list of strings | [] | Restrict which rule systems are loaded: coddy, agents-dir (.agents/rules), cursor, claude, codex, agents (nested AGENTS.md). Empty means all. |

### `mcp_servers`

Model Context Protocol servers connected for every new session.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `mcp_servers` | list of objects |  | Model Context Protocol servers connected for every new session. |
| `mcp_servers[].type` | string, one of `stdio`, `http`, `sse` |  | Transport. "stdio" (default when empty; url-only entries default to "http") runs a local command; "http" speaks streamable HTTP to url (with automatic legacy-SSE fallback); "sse" forces the legacy HTTP+SSE transport. |
| `mcp_servers[].name` | string |  | Stable id referenced by the agent; must be unique in this list. |
| `mcp_servers[].command` | string |  | Executable for stdio transport (leave empty when using an http url). ${CWD} expands to the session cwd. |
| `mcp_servers[].args` | list of strings |  | Argv passed after command for stdio servers. ${CWD} expands to the session cwd. |
| `mcp_servers[].env` | list of objects |  | Extra environment variables for the stdio child process. |
| `mcp_servers[].env[].name` | string |  | Environment variable name. |
| `mcp_servers[].env[].value` | string |  | Environment variable value. ${CWD} expands to the session cwd. |
| `mcp_servers[].url` | string |  | HTTP(S) endpoint when type is "http". ${CWD} expands to the session cwd. |
| `mcp_servers[].headers` | list of objects |  | Optional headers sent with MCP HTTP requests. ${CWD} in a value expands to the session cwd. |
| `mcp_servers[].headers[].name` | string |  | HTTP header name. |
| `mcp_servers[].headers[].value` | string |  | HTTP header value. |
| `mcp_servers[].disabled` | boolean |  | Skip connecting this server without removing its definition. |
| `mcp_servers[].disabled_tools` | list of strings |  | Tool names of this server hidden from the agent. |

### `mcp`

MCP settings that are not tied to a single server entry.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `mcp.project_trust` | string, one of `ask`, `allow`, `deny` | ask | Trust policy for the project-local <cwd>/.coddy/mcp.json, which travels with the checkout: "ask" keeps its servers cold until the operator approves that exact declaration for that workspace; "allow" starts them automatically (trusted workspaces only); "deny" never loads them. |

### `tools`

Filesystem and shell policy for built-in tools.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `tools.permission_mode` | string, one of `ask`, `accept_edits`, `bypass` | ask | When the agent asks for user approval: "ask" prompts for commands and file writes; "accept_edits" auto-approves writes but prompts for commands; "bypass" never asks (trusted environments only). |
| `tools.command_allowlist` | list of strings |  | Commands that never require permission. Exact or prefix match (prefix + space + any args). "*" allows all commands. |
| `tools.ssh_connect_timeout` | integer | 30 | TCP dial timeout for SSH connections (ssh_run_command tool), in seconds. |
| `tools.output_limits` | object |  | Maximum lines each tool result or error may return into the LLM context. Every enabled limit also applies a 64 KiB per-call byte safety ceiling so a huge single line cannot bypass it. 0 disables both limits for that tool. Unset fields fall back to the built-in defaults. |
| `tools.output_limits.read` | integer or null | 1000 | Max lines for a read file page or directory listing. |
| `tools.output_limits.grep` | integer or null | 200 | Max path:line:content records returned by grep. |
| `tools.output_limits.glob` | integer or null | 300 | Max paths returned by glob. |
| `tools.output_limits.print_tree` | integer or null | 400 | Max lines of a directory tree. |
| `tools.output_limits.run_command` | integer or null | 500 | Max combined stdout+stderr lines of a shell command. |
| `tools.output_limits.ssh_run_command` | integer or null | 500 | Max combined stdout+stderr lines of a remote SSH command. |
| `tools.output_limits.webfetch` | integer or null | 800 | Max lines of fetched page markdown. |
| `tools.output_limits.websearch` | integer or null | 200 | Max lines of search results. |
| `tools.output_limits.default` | integer or null | 1000 | Applies to any tool not named above, including MCP tools. 0 means unlimited. |
| `tools.background` | object |  | Commands the agent runs detached in the session task pool instead of blocking a turn. The pool dies with the coddy process; each task's metadata and captured output stay in the session bundle, and a task interrupted by a restart is reported as orphaned. |
| `tools.background.enable` | boolean or null | true | Offer the background option on run_command and expose the background task tools. |
| `tools.background.max_concurrent` | integer | 5 | How many background tasks one session may run at once. 0 uses the default. |
| `tools.background.default_timeout_seconds` | integer | 900 | Hard limit for a task started without an explicit timeout and without a duration estimate. 0 uses the default. |
| `tools.background.max_timeout_seconds` | integer | 3600 | Ceiling applied to any requested or estimate-derived timeout. 0 uses the default. |
| `tools.background.output_buffer_bytes` | integer | 262144 | How much of each task's output stays in memory for the status ticker. The full log is still written to the session bundle. 0 uses the default. |

### `subagents`

User-defined child agents the model can delegate to with spawn_agent. Definitions are markdown files with YAML frontmatter; each run is a background task of the parent session with its own child session and transcript. See https://coddy.dev/docs/features/subagents.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `subagents.enable` | boolean or null | true | Register the spawn_agent tool and list the subagent catalog in the system prompt. |
| `subagents.dirs` | list of strings | ["${CODDY_HOME}/agents","${CWD}/.claude/agents","${CWD}/.coddy/agents"] | Definition directories, lowest priority first; later entries override earlier ones by name. ${CODDY_HOME} and ${CWD} expand. Directories inside the workspace are project scope and follow project_trust. |
| `subagents.project_trust` | string, one of `ask`, `allow`, `deny` | ask | Trust policy for definitions found inside the workspace, which travel with the checkout: "ask" loads them but refuses to spawn one until the operator approved that exact file for that workspace on the machine running coddy (coddy agents trust there, or POST /coddy/subagents/{name}/trust with the session workspace as cwd); "allow" treats them like the operator's own files; "deny" never reads them. |
| `subagents.max_concurrent` | integer | 4 | How many subagent runs the whole process may have in flight at once, whatever session started them. Starting past the limit is refused, not queued. 0 uses the default. |
| `subagents.max_depth` | integer or null | 1 | How deep spawning may nest: 1 lets a session spawn subagents that cannot spawn further; 0 forbids spawning everywhere. Omit for the default. |
| `subagents.default_timeout_seconds` | integer | 1800 | Hard limit for one run whose definition and call give no timeout. Capped by tools.background.max_timeout_seconds. 0 uses the default. |
| `subagents.max_turns` | integer | 0 | ReAct rounds a child may take. 0 follows agent.max_turns. |

### `hooks`

Operator commands run at lifecycle points of a session: before and after a tool call, when a prompt is submitted, when the agent stops, on session start and around compaction. Definitions are JSON files in the Claude Code shape (~/.coddy/hooks.json, .coddy/hooks.json, .claude/settings*.json). See https://coddy.dev/docs/features/hooks.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `hooks.enable` | boolean or null | true | Load and run hooks at all. |
| `hooks.files` | list of strings | ["${CODDY_HOME}/hooks.json","${CWD}/.claude/settings.json","${CWD}/.claude/settings.local.json","${CWD}/.coddy/hooks.json"] | Definition files, lowest priority first; every matching hook runs. ${CODDY_HOME} and ${CWD} expand; a relative entry resolves against the session cwd. Files inside the workspace are project scope and follow project_trust; only the hooks key of a Claude Code settings file is read. |
| `hooks.project_trust` | string, one of `ask`, `allow`, `deny` | ask | Trust policy for hook files found inside the workspace, which travel with the checkout: "ask" lists them but runs nothing until the operator approved that exact file for that workspace on the machine running coddy (coddy hooks trust there, or POST /coddy/hooks/trust with the session workspace as cwd); "allow" treats them like the operator's own file; "deny" never reads them. |
| `hooks.default_timeout_seconds` | integer | 60 | Hard limit for one hook process whose definition gives no timeout. 0 uses the default. |
| `hooks.stop_loop_limit` | integer | 5 | How many times per turn a Stop hook may send the agent back to work. 0 uses the default. |
| `hooks.max_output_chars` | integer | 10000 | Cap on the context, messages and reasons one hook may hand to the model or the user; longer values are truncated with a marker. 0 uses the default. |

### `logger`

Process log level, outputs, format, and file rotation.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `logger.level` | string, one of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `warning`, `error` | info | Minimum severity written to the configured outputs ("warning" is accepted as an alias of "warn"). |
| `logger.levels` | list of objects |  | Per-component minimum severity. A component is the dotted name a record carries in its "component" attribute (gateway, gateway.telegram, session, agent, scheduler); a parent name covers everything nested under it and the longest configured prefix wins. Records with no component follow "level". |
| `logger.levels[].component` | string |  | Dotted component name, for example "gateway.telegram". |
| `logger.levels[].level` | string, one of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `warning`, `error` |  | Minimum severity for this component. |
| `logger.outputs` | list of strings | ["stderr"] | Where log records go; any combination of stdout, stderr, file. Empty means stderr only. |
| `logger.file` | string |  | Path for the file sink; required when outputs includes "file". Supports ${CODDY_HOME}. |
| `logger.format` | string, one of `text`, `json` | text | Log record format. |
| `logger.rotation` | object |  | Size-based rotation for the file sink. |
| `logger.rotation.max_size_mb` | integer | 0 | Rotate after the file reaches this size in MB; 0 disables size-based rotation. |
| `logger.rotation.max_files` | integer | 0 | Rotated backups to keep when max_size_mb > 0. |

### `sessions`

Where persisted session bundles are stored.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `sessions.dir` | string | "" | Sessions root directory. Empty resolves to ${CODDY_HOME}/sessions. Supports ${CODDY_HOME} and ~. |

### `compaction`

Summarizes older conversation history so long sessions keep fitting the model context window. Manual compact command plus automatic trigger at a percent of the model's max_context_tokens.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `compaction.enable` | boolean or null | true | Master switch for compaction (manual command and automatic trigger). Defaults to true. |
| `compaction.threshold_percent` | integer | 80 | Auto-compaction fires when the estimated context usage reaches this percent of the effective model's max_context_tokens (1..100). Models without max_context_tokens skip auto-compaction; the manual command still works. |
| `compaction.keep_recent_turns` | integer or null | 2 | How many most recent user turns (each with the agent replies and tool activity after it) stay verbatim; only history before that boundary is summarized. 0 summarizes the whole window. |
| `compaction.model` | string | "" | Optional models[].model used for the summarization call. Empty uses the session's effective model. |
| `compaction.result_eviction` | object |  | Collapses superseded read/grep tool results to short placeholders when building the LLM request (the persisted transcript is never rewritten), so paging a large file or a wide search cannot pin dead lines in every later turn. Only results the model marks (keep_result, or keep:true) or the most recent working window survive; a write to a file invalidates earlier reads/greps that covered it. |
| `compaction.result_eviction.enable` | boolean or null | true | Master switch for read/grep result eviction. Defaults to true. |
| `compaction.result_eviction.keep_recent` | integer or null | 2 | How many most recent evictable results (read pages, grep dumps) stay intact as a working window. 0 keeps none. The default of 2 keeps a read and a grep live at the same time; with 1, a model comparing two results keeps re-fetching whichever the other evicted. |
| `compaction.result_eviction.min_result_bytes` | integer or null | 2000 | Results at or below this size are never evicted (too small to be worth a placeholder). 0 makes every result a candidate. |

### `memory`

Optional memory copilot (implementation in external/memory; enable at runtime with memory.enable).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `memory.enable` | boolean | false | Turn on the memory copilot. |
| `memory.model` | string | "" | Exact models[].model id used only for recall/persist LLM calls; empty falls back to agent.model or the session override. |
| `memory.dir` | string | "" | Long-term memory root. Empty resolves to ${CODDY_HOME}/memory. Supports ${CODDY_HOME} and ~. |
| `memory.recall_max_turns` | integer | 6 | Bounds recall-side LLM rounds in the memory loop. |
| `memory.persist_max_turns` | integer | 12 | Bounds persist-side LLM rounds in the memory loop. |
| `memory.copilot_max_tokens` | integer | 4096 | Completion token cap for memory copilot LLM calls. |
| `memory.max_search_hits` | integer | 8 | Maximum snippets returned by memory_search. |

### `httpserver`

OpenAI-compatible HTTP API defaults (used only by binaries built with -tags http; the embedded SPA needs -tags http,ui). See https://coddy.dev/docs/reference/http-api.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `httpserver.enable` | boolean or null | true | Serve the HTTP API (and the embedded SPA) in this process. Omitted means true; set false on a node that only polls a messenger or relays a swarm. |
| `httpserver.host` | string | 127.0.0.1 | Bind address for the HTTP API. Empty means 127.0.0.1; set 0.0.0.0 to accept connections from other machines. |
| `httpserver.port` | integer | 0 | Default listen port when coddy serve does not pass -P/--port. 0 falls back to 12345. |
| `httpserver.auth_token` | string | "" | Optional bearer credential for the HTTP API. Empty means no authentication (historical default). Use a "${ENV}" reference to keep the secret out of the file; never echoed back by GET /coddy/config. Prefer --auth-token / CODDY_HTTP_TOKEN to keep it out of config.yaml entirely. See https://coddy.dev/docs/operate/remote. |
| `httpserver.public_docs` | boolean | false | When auth is enabled, keep /docs and /openapi.* reachable without a token. |
| `httpserver.allow_insecure` | boolean | false | Silence the startup warning about a non-loopback bind without authentication. |
| `httpserver.cors` | object |  | Cross-origin access so a browser UI on another origin can call this API (e.g. the bundled UI pointed at a remote server). Bearer auth still applies. |
| `httpserver.cors.enable` | boolean | false | Handle CORS preflight and emit Access-Control-* headers for allowed origins. |
| `httpserver.cors.allowed_origins` | list of strings | [] | Exact origins permitted to call the API, e.g. "http://localhost:5173". A single "*" allows any origin. |
| `httpserver.remotes` | list of objects | [] | Remote coddy serve servers offered in the UI environment selector. Tokens are not stored here; the UI keeps them client-side per remote. |
| `httpserver.remotes[].name` | string |  | Display label for the remote. |
| `httpserver.remotes[].url` | string |  | Base URL of the remote coddy serve server, e.g. "https://box.example:12345". |

### `swarm`

Stateless relay that nodes register into and that chains into other relays. The relay itself needs -tags swarm and swarm.enable; the join list below is honoured by any coddy serve process, which is what makes an ordinary agent reachable through a relay. See https://coddy.dev/docs/operate/swarm.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `swarm.enable` | boolean | false | Run the swarm relay in this process. Independent of swarm.join, which is how an agent registers into a parent relay. |
| `swarm.host` | string | "" | Bind address for the relay when the CLI does not pass --swarm-host. Empty falls back to 0.0.0.0. |
| `swarm.port` | integer | 0 | Listen port for the relay. 0 falls back to 12346. |
| `swarm.name` | string | "" | Label for this relay in topology views and in a child's node path. |
| `swarm.auth_token` | string | "" | Bearer credential clients present to this relay. A relay reaches every node with that node's own credential, so an unauthenticated relay bound off loopback is a fleet-wide open door and the server refuses to start unless allow_insecure is set. Never echoed back. |
| `swarm.pairing_tokens` | list of strings | [] | Credentials a node must present to register. Empty closes registration unless insecure_open_registration is set. Never echoed back. |
| `swarm.allow_insecure` | boolean | false | Permit binding off loopback without a client token. |
| `swarm.insecure_open_registration` | boolean | false | Let any caller register a node without a pairing token. Development only. |
| `swarm.allow_private_upstreams` | list of strings | [] | Hosts a node may advertise even though they resolve into loopback or private ranges, which are otherwise refused so a registration cannot turn the relay into a probe of its own network. |
| `swarm.cors` | object |  | Cross-origin access for the relay API. The SPA reaches a relay from another origin by construction, so this usually has to be on. Allow-Headers includes Last-Event-ID so an SSE stream can be resumed through the relay. |
| `swarm.cors.enable` | boolean | false | Handle CORS preflight and emit Access-Control-* headers for allowed origins. |
| `swarm.cors.allowed_origins` | list of strings | [] | Exact origins permitted to call the API, e.g. "http://localhost:5173". A single "*" allows any origin. |
| `swarm.tls` | object |  | Serve the relay over HTTPS. Set both files or neither. Minimum TLS 1.2; certificates are startup state, so rotating them needs a restart. |
| `swarm.tls.cert_file` | string | "" | PEM certificate chain. |
| `swarm.tls.key_file` | string | "" | PEM private key. |
| `swarm.lease_ttl_seconds` | integer | 0 | How long a registration survives without a heartbeat. 0 falls back to 90; nodes refresh at a third of it. |
| `swarm.fanout_timeout_seconds` | integer | 0 | Per-node deadline for an aggregated call. A slower node degrades into a warning rather than stalling the answer. 0 falls back to 3. |
| `swarm.upstreams` | list of objects | [] | Nodes configured by hand rather than registered, for an agent that cannot run the join loop. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].name` | string |  | Node name; becomes a URL path segment, so letters, digits, underscore and hyphen only. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].url` | string |  | Origin the relay dials to reach the node. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].kind` | string, one of `""`, `agent`, `relay` | "" | agent (default) or relay. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].token` | string | "" | Bearer credential the relay presents to this node. Never echoed back. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].dial` | object |  | How this leg reaches the other side. Relays are expected to live in different networks, so a proxy hop and a private certificate authority are ordinary here. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].dial.proxy` | string | "" | Route the connection through a proxy: http, https, socks5 or socks5h. Empty falls back to the standard environment variables. Never echoed back. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].dial.ca_file` | string | "" | Certificate authority used to verify a peer whose certificate is signed privately. |
| `swarm.upstreams[].dial.insecure_skip_verify` | boolean | false | Accept any certificate. For a lab only; every use is logged. |
| `swarm.join` | list of objects | [] | Parent relays this process registers into on startup. Honoured whether or not this process runs a relay of its own, which is what lets relays chain. |
| `swarm.join[].url` | string |  | Parent relay origin. |
| `swarm.join[].name` | string | "" | Name to claim in that relay. Empty falls back to the host name. |
| `swarm.join[].pairing_token` | string | "" | Credential authorising the registration. Never echoed back. |
| `swarm.join[].advertise_url` | string | "" | Where the relay can reach this process. Leave empty to select the tunnel transport: this process dials out and serves its API back over that connection, which is the only way in when the network accepts no inbound connections. |
| `swarm.join[].token` | string | "" | This process's own bearer credential, handed to the relay so it can authenticate when it proxies. Prefer a credential minted for the relay alone. Never echoed back. |
| `swarm.join[].labels` | map of strings |  | Free-form tags shown in topology views. |
| `swarm.join[].dial` | object |  | How this leg reaches the other side. Relays are expected to live in different networks, so a proxy hop and a private certificate authority are ordinary here. |
| `swarm.join[].dial.proxy` | string | "" | Route the connection through a proxy: http, https, socks5 or socks5h. Empty falls back to the standard environment variables. Never echoed back. |
| `swarm.join[].dial.ca_file` | string | "" | Certificate authority used to verify a peer whose certificate is signed privately. |
| `swarm.join[].dial.insecure_skip_verify` | boolean | false | Accept any certificate. For a lab only; every use is logged. |

### `ui`

Controls the bundled single-page UI (only meaningful in binaries built with -tags http,ui).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `ui.enable` | boolean or null | true | Serve the embedded SPA at GET /. Defaults to true; set false to run an API-only server (the API still requires httpserver.auth_token when configured). |

### `scheduler`

Cron-driven scheduled jobs (used only by binaries built with -tags scheduler). Jobs are flat *.md files with YAML frontmatter under scheduler.dir; five-field crontab in UTC.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `scheduler.enable` | boolean | false | Run the scheduler daemon and expose the coddy_scheduler_* tools. Can also be forced per process with coddy serve --scheduler (or coddy acp -scheduler). |
| `scheduler.dir` | string | "" | Directory with *.md job definitions. Empty resolves to ${CODDY_HOME}/scheduler. |
| `scheduler.max_queue` | integer | 10 | Concurrent scheduled runs; when saturated, extra firings are skipped until a slot frees. |
| `scheduler.timeout` | string | 30m | Wall-clock limit for one scheduled agent run, as a Go duration (e.g. "30m", "1h30m"). |
| `scheduler.retain_sessions` | integer | 5 | Completed scheduler-run session directories kept per job_id under sessions.dir; older runs are pruned. |

### `gateways`

Messenger bot adapters (used only by binaries built with -tags gateway or -tags gateway.telegram; started by coddy serve alongside every other enabled subsystem). See https://coddy.dev/docs/surfaces/gateway.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `gateways.telegram` | object |  | Telegram bot adapter. |
| `gateways.telegram.enable` | boolean | false | Poll Telegram in this coddy serve process. |
| `gateways.telegram.token` | string | "" | Bot token from @BotFather. Leave empty to read the TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN environment variable (e.g. via ~/.coddy/.env). |
| `gateways.telegram.proxy` | string | "" | Optional outbound proxy for Telegram API requests: http, https, socks5, or socks5h URL. |
| `gateways.telegram.rich_messages` | boolean | false | Use Bot API 10.1 Rich Messages (native Markdown, streamed thinking placeholder, collapsible tool list). Falls back to legacy formatting when unsupported. |
| `gateways.telegram.admins` | list of integers |  | Telegram user IDs with elevated rights; admins always pass access checks. |
| `gateways.telegram.default_access` | string | all | Fallback access level for chats without an override: "all", "admins", or "group:<name>". |
| `gateways.telegram.default_isolation` | string, one of `individual`, `shared`, `admin` | individual | Fallback session isolation for group chats: "individual" (session per user), "shared" (one session for all), "admin" (admins only, shared session). |
| `gateways.telegram.user_groups` | list of objects |  | Named sets of user IDs referenced from access fields as group:<name>. |
| `gateways.telegram.user_groups[].name` | string |  | Group name referenced as group:<name>. |
| `gateways.telegram.user_groups[].user_ids` | list of integers |  | Telegram numeric user IDs in this group. |
| `gateways.telegram.chats` | list of objects |  | Per-chat overrides; chat_id is negative for groups and supergroups. |
| `gateways.telegram.chats[].chat_id` | integer |  | Telegram chat id (negative for groups/supergroups). |
| `gateways.telegram.chats[].isolation` | string, one of `individual`, `shared`, `admin` |  | Per-chat session isolation override. |
| `gateways.telegram.chats[].access` | string |  | Per-chat access override: "all", "admins", or "group:<name>". |

## Notes

### `providers`

List of LLM backends (`[]config.ProviderConfig`, `internal/config/providers.go`).

Key resolution order: `api_key` → `api_key_command` stdout → `NAME_API_KEY` env var.

```yaml
providers:
  - name: openai
    type: openai
    api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  - name: local
    type: openai
    api_base: "http://localhost:11434/v1"
    api_key: "~"
  - name: neuraldeep
    type: neuraldeep
    api_key: "${NEURALDEEP_API_KEY}"
    # usage_limits_panel: false  # hide the account usage panel for this row
  - name: codex
    type: codex # use Sign In with ChatGPT in the bundled web UI; no api_key needed
```

#### llama.cpp as an OpenAI-compatible provider

`llama-server` works as a `type: openai` provider (`api_base: "http://host:8080/v1"`). Recommended launch flags:

- `--jinja` - enables the model's chat template on the server, which is required for **tool calling**. Without it llama.cpp silently ignores the `tools` parameter and the agent loop degrades to plain text answers.
- `-c <n>` - set the context window large enough for an agent prompt (system prompt plus tool schemas plus history; 16k is a practical minimum, more is better). When a request exceeds the server context, llama.cpp reports `the request exceeds the available context size` - raise `-c` or trim `max_context_tokens`.

llama.cpp builds through 2025 report mid-stream failures with a non-standard SSE `error:` field; Coddy understands both that dialect and the current `data: {"error": ...}` shape and surfaces the server's message in the error.

For `type: codex`, open **Settings → LLM Providers** in the bundled web UI and select **Sign In with ChatGPT**, or run the terminal equivalent for ACP and headless setups:

```bash
coddy providers login codex    # device flow: prints a URL and a one-time code, then waits
coddy providers list           # every provider with the credential its requests actually use,
                               # plus a warning for an openai row that has neither api_base
                               # nor a credential (its requests leave for api.openai.com)
coddy providers logout codex   # removes the Coddy-managed credential (leaves the Codex CLI login alone)
```

(Up to 1.0.11 the same flow also had a codex-only command, `coddy codex login | status | logout`. It was removed in favour of the commands above, which cover every backend; `coddy providers list` reports what `codex status` used to.)

A successful login also publishes the subscription catalog into `config.yaml`, the way `coddy providers login neuraldeep` publishes its tier models (the Settings button stores the credential only): it adds the `codex` provider row when it is missing, one `models[]` entry per catalog model Codex lists (the ids Codex hides from its own picker, such as `gpt-reserve` and `codex-auto-review`, are left out), and `agent.model` when nothing is set yet - Codex's own top-ranked model. Nothing already in the file is rewritten: an existing provider row, an already listed model, and a chosen `agent.model` survive untouched, so a repeated login is a no-op. `--no-config` stores only the credential. Entries carry no `max_tokens`, because the Codex backend rejects `max_output_tokens`. A running `coddy serve` keeps its loaded config, so restart it to pick the new models up.

Both paths use the same storage; the provider name is the argument, so `coddy providers login <name>` targets a specific codex row when `config.yaml` defines several (a row under a name other than `codex` has to exist in `config.yaml` first). Coddy uses the official device authorization flow and stores refreshable credentials at `$CODDY_HOME/providers/<provider-name>/codex-auth.json` with restrictive file permissions; tokens never enter `config.yaml`. `api_key`, `api_key_command`, and `api_base` are ignored for Codex, while `proxy` applies to OAuth and provider requests. The model picker reads the catalog from the official Codex backend with the saved token. If no Coddy-managed credential exists, Coddy remains compatible with a Codex CLI login in `~/.codex/auth.json` (or `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`). Codex requests always target the official backend; the process-level `CODDY_CODEX_BASE_URL` is the only override (tests and self-hosted gateways), so a settings document can never redirect an OAuth token on its own.

Codex is only a model backend: the agent keeps Coddy's own system prompt, tool catalog, permissions, and ReAct loop, and the ChatGPT credential is used solely to authenticate the Responses calls (`features/codex_auth.feature` pins this on both the HTTP and ACP surfaces).

**Token lifetime.** The access token is refreshed transparently shortly before it expires, and the refreshed tokens are written back to the file they came from. When the credential is the Codex CLI login, that file is `~/.codex/auth.json` itself - the same file the `codex` CLI reads, so both tools keep working off one login, and a refresh performed by Coddy is visible to the CLI (and vice versa). A Coddy-managed credential is refreshed in place under `$CODDY_HOME/providers/<name>/` and never touches the CLI login. Signing out (`coddy providers logout codex`, or **Sign Out** in Settings) removes only the Coddy-managed file.

**Startup report.** When at least one `type: codex` provider is configured, `coddy acp` and `coddy serve` log one `codex credential` line per provider at startup: where the credential came from and how long the access token is still valid. A missing credential, an unusable `auth_mode`, or an expired token with no refresh token left is logged as a **warning** naming `coddy providers login <name>`; an expired but refreshable token is only an informational line, since the next request renews it. Setups without a codex provider log nothing.

**Reasoning.** The Codex backend serves `gpt-5*` and `gpt-6*` model ids but accepts only `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, and `xhigh`, so codex-backed models offer **`none`** where other providers offer `minimal` (an explicit `reasoning_levels: [minimal]` is remapped as well). Reasoning turns request summaries (`summary: auto`) so thinking streams into the UI, and encrypted reasoning (`include: reasoning.encrypted_content`) so the model's own chain of thought is replayed verbatim on the next request of the same turn - the same flow the Codex CLI uses. Replayed reasoning is tagged with the model that produced it and is skipped when the session switches models. The items are stored opaquely in `messages.json` (`reasoning_signature`, ~1 KB per assistant turn) and are not exposed by `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/messages`.

### `models`

List of logical models (`[]config.ModelEntry`, `internal/config/models.go`).

```yaml
models:
  - model: "openai/gpt-5.6-terra"
    max_tokens: 8192
    reasoning_default: medium
    multimodal: true
  - model: "openai/gpt-5"
    max_tokens: 8192
    reasoning_default: medium
  - model: "local/qwen3-30b"
    max_tokens: 8192
    stream: false
```

**Non-streaming models.** `stream: false` changes one thing: coddy sends a single blocking `POST /chat/completions` instead of asking for SSE, and hands the finished answer to the rest of the runtime in one piece. Everything downstream is unchanged, so the transcript, tool calls, and session bundle look the same; what differs is that nothing appears until the model is done, and the thinking row shows no live duration. Two consequences are worth knowing before turning it on. Pressing **Stop** during a blocking call loses the whole answer, because the server has sent nothing yet, whereas a streamed turn keeps the tokens that already arrived. And a client asking for an SSE stream still gets one - the switch governs the connection to the LLM, not the connection to the client - which is why a streaming HTTP response now carries a keepalive comment every 15 s so proxies do not drop a turn that stays silent for minutes.

The switch is rejected for `type: codex` providers. The Codex Responses backend has no blocking mode, so honoring the key there would mean streaming anyway and only pretending not to.

### `agent`

ReAct loop settings (`config.Agent`, `internal/config/agent.go`).

### `prompts`

System prompt template overrides (`config.Prompts`, `internal/config/prompts.go`). Template fields are documented in [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md#full-configuration-schema).

### `instructions`

Project instruction files (`config.Instructions`, `internal/config/instructions.go`).

### `skills`

Skill discovery (`config.Skills`, `internal/config/skills.go`).

### `rules`

Project rules discovery (`config.Rules`, `internal/config/rules.go`). See [rules.md](../features/rules.md).

### `mcp_servers`

MCP servers connected for every new session (`[]config.MCPServerConfig`, `internal/config/mcp_servers.go`).

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  - name: filesystem
    command: npx
    args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/home/user"]
    disabled_tools: ["write_file"]
```

Servers can also be declared in Cursor-compatible mcp.json files: the user-global
`~/.coddy/mcp.json` (like Cursor's `~/.cursor/mcp.json`; together with this
`mcp_servers` list it forms the "global" scope) and the project-local
`<workspace>/.coddy/mcp.json` ("local" scope). Each file holds a single
`mcpServers` object keyed by server name (`env` and `headers` are JSON objects;
per-tool switches use `disabledTools`). Later levels override earlier ones by
name: `mcp_servers` < `~/.coddy/mcp.json` < `./.coddy/mcp.json`. Entries from the
project-local file need a workspace approval before they are started - see
[`mcp`](#mcp) and `docs/features/mcp.md`.

### `mcp`

MCP settings that are not tied to a single server entry (`config.MCP`, `internal/config/mcp.go`).

Added for [issue #80](https://github.com/coddy-project/coddy-agent/issues/80).
Approvals are recorded in `~/.coddy/mcp-trust.json`, keyed by the canonical workspace path
and a digest of the command-bearing declaration (transport, command, args, env, url,
headers), so rewriting an approved entry asks again. Approve with `coddy mcp trust <name>`,
`POST /coddy/mcp/{name}/trust`, or the shield button in **Settings → MCP servers**. That tab
also edits this policy itself (`POST /coddy/mcp/project-trust`), so it is not rendered as a
separate settings section. See `docs/features/mcp.md`.

### `tools`

Permission policy (`config.Tools`, `internal/config/tools.go`).

#### `tools.output_limits`

Maximum lines a tool result or error may return into the LLM context (`config.ToolOutputLimits`). Every enabled line limit also applies a hard **64 KiB per-call byte ceiling**, preventing a minified file, base64 payload, or one-line MCP response from bypassing the guard. `0` disables both limits for that tool; an unset field falls back to the built-in default. Truncated output ends with a marker telling the model how to fetch the rest (`offset`/`limit` for `read`, a narrower pattern for `grep`, `page` for `websearch`).

#### `tools.background`

Bounds for background execution (`config.ToolBackground`). A backgrounded `run_command` returns a task id instead of output; `background_list`, `background_output`, `background_wait`, and `background_stop` collect the result later. The pool lives inside the running `coddy` process: each task mirrors its metadata and captured output into the session bundle under `background/<task_id>/`, and a task interrupted by a restart is reported as `orphaned` rather than as still running. `0` on any integer field means "use the default". See `docs/features/background-tasks.md`.

### `subagents`

Subagents (`config.Subagents`, `internal/config/subagents.go`): child agents the model delegates to with the `spawn_agent` tool. A definition is a markdown file with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `mode`, `tools`, `disallowed_tools`, `permission_mode`, `max_turns`, `timeout_seconds`, `background`, `hidden`) whose body is the child's role. Each run is a background task of the parent session with its own child session and transcript, so `background_list` / `background_output` / `background_wait` / `background_stop`, the Tasks panel and `GET /coddy/sessions/{id}/background-tasks` all see it. `0` on `max_concurrent`, `default_timeout_seconds` and `max_turns` means "use the default"; `max_depth` is the exception, omit it for the default `1`, because an explicit `0` forbids spawning everywhere. See `docs/features/subagents.md`.

Approvals for project-scope definitions are recorded in `~/.coddy/subagents-trust.json`, keyed by the canonical workspace path, the definition name and a digest of the file, so editing an approved file asks again. `permission_mode`, `tools` and `disallowed_tools` in a definition can only narrow what the parent could do, in every scope.

### `hooks`

Hooks (`config.Hooks`, `internal/config/hooks.go`): operator commands run at lifecycle points of a session. A hook reads one JSON document on stdin and answers with an exit code plus optional JSON on stdout; a `PreToolUse` hook can deny a tool call whatever the permission mode, approve it past the prompt, force the prompt, rewrite its arguments or add context, and a `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` hook can add feedback. Definitions are JSON files in Claude Code's shape. `0` on every integer key means "use the default". See `docs/features/hooks.md`.

Approvals for project-scope files are recorded in `~/.coddy/hooks-trust.json`, keyed by the canonical workspace path, the workspace-relative file path and a digest of the file, so editing an approved file asks again.

### `logger`

Logging (`config.Logger`, `internal/config/logger.go`). ACP flags `--log-level`, `--log-output`, `--log-file`, `--log-format` override these when set.

`levels` raises or lowers verbosity one subsystem at a time, so chasing a Telegram command that does not work no longer means turning the whole process to `debug` and reading it out of everything else:

```yaml
logger:
  level: "info"
  levels:
    - component: "gateway.telegram"
      level: "debug"
```

A component is the dotted name a subsystem tags its logger with, and it stays on every record that subsystem writes, so a file can also be filtered by subsystem after the fact. A parent name covers everything nested under it and the longest configured prefix wins: `gateway` reaches `gateway.telegram` unless that name carries its own entry. A record from an untagged part of the process has no component and follows `level`. Configuring one component twice is an error rather than a silent winner.

`--log-level` accepts the same spec as a comma-separated list, which is how an operator running under systemd raises one subsystem for a single restart without editing the file:

```bash
coddy serve --log-level "info,gateway.telegram=debug"
```

A bare `--log-level debug` sets only the root level and leaves the configured entries alone; a spec that names components replaces them, so the flag is a complete statement of what to log.

### `sessions`

Session bundle storage (`config.Sessions`, `internal/config/sessions.go`).

### `compaction`

Context compaction (`config.Compaction`, `internal/config/compaction.go`): summarizing older conversation history so long sessions keep fitting the model context window. Applies to the manual compact command and the automatic threshold trigger.

#### `compaction.result_eviction`

Collapses unmarked `read`/`grep` tool results to short placeholders when building the LLM request (`config.ResultEviction`), so paging a large file or running a wide search cannot pin dead lines in every later turn. A result survives when the model marks it (the `keep_result` tool, or `keep: true` on the call) or when it is inside the most recent working window; a filesystem write to a file invalidates earlier reads/greps that covered it. The persisted session bundle keeps every result in full.

### `memory`

Long-term memory copilot (`config.MemoryConfig`, `internal/config/memory.go`; implementation in `external/memory`, `memory` build tag).

### `httpserver`

OpenAI-compatible HTTP API defaults (`config.HTTPServerConfig`, `internal/config/http.go`; `http` build tag). See [http-api.md](http-api.md).

### `swarm`

Stateless relay that nodes register into and that chains into other relays (`config.SwarmConfig`, `internal/config/swarm.go`; `swarm` build tag for the server side, though `swarm.join` is honoured by every `coddy serve` process). See [swarm.md](../operate/swarm.md).

### `ui`

Embedded web UI (`config.UIConfig`, `internal/config/ui.go`; only meaningful with `-tags http,ui`).

### `scheduler`

Cron scheduler (`config.SchedulerConfig`, `internal/config/scheduler.go`; `scheduler` build tag). Job file format is described in [Configuration](../getting-started/configuration.md#scheduler-optional-build).

### `gateways`

Messenger gateways (`config.GatewayConfig`, `internal/config/gateway.go`; `gateway` or `gateway.telegram` build tag; run with `coddy serve`). See [gateway.md](../surfaces/gateway.md).

#### `gateways.telegram`

## Related environment variables
