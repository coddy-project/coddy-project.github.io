# Interactive console TUI (`coddy` / `coddy cli`)

A four-minute recording of a console session, from launch and the model picker through file work with permission prompts to `coddy -c` and `--remote`, is [console.mp4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coddy-project/coddy-agent/main/docs/assets/video/console.mp4) (GitHub plays it on the file page).

The console surface is a terminal UI over the same machinery every other
surface uses: `session.Manager`, the agent runner, and ACP session updates.
Nothing agent-side is console-specific — the TUI is a fourth `UpdateSender`
next to ACP, HTTP, and the Telegram gateway.

Build: `make build TAGS=cli` (or any tag set including `cli`; the recommended
full binary is `make build TAGS="http ui scheduler memory cli gateway swarm"`). In builds
without the tag, `coddy cli` explains how to rebuild and bare `coddy` keeps
printing usage.

Launch: bare `coddy` on a terminal (both stdin and stdout must be ttys —
pipes and CI keep the usage contract), explicitly `coddy cli [flags]`, or with
flag-style shortcuts routed to the console: `coddy -c` continues the latest
session in this folder and `coddy -p "..."` runs one non-interactive prompt.
Startup runs before the terminal enters raw mode: the config, the session
store, the skills, the rule folders and the configured MCP servers, then
the first frame. Nothing reads the workspace tree: nested `AGENTS.md` files
are read on demand, from the folders a tool enters (`docs/features/rules.md`), so a
console opened in a home directory (a macOS `~/Library` alone runs to
hundreds of thousands of entries) draws its frame at once instead of
looking hung. The git branch in the footer is read with a three-second
bound for the same reason. A first ctrl+c during startup cancels it; a
second one ends the process the default way instead of being swallowed.

Quitting the console (double ctrl+c, ctrl+d, `/quit`) prints a resume hint
after the terminal is restored:

```
session: sess_1a2b3c4d
continue: coddy cli --session-id sess_1a2b3c4d  (or: coddy -c)
```

## Visual model

The layout replicates the pi coding agent's TUI (pi-mono `b1efcf7d7`,
v0.84.2, MIT, Mario Zechner — see the attribution note below) with colors
from the coddy SPA palette (`external/ui/src/styles.css`); this document is
the visual contract for the coddy console.

Top to bottom:

- **Header**: `coddy` (bold accent) + dim version; a dim hint line
  (`escape interrupt · ctrl+c/ctrl+d clear/exit · / commands · ctrl+o more`);
  `[Context]` (instruction files) and `[Skills]` (loaded skill names).
  `ctrl+o` expands the full hint list and adds `[Rules]` and `[MCP]` sections.
- **Transcript**: user messages in full-width background boxes; assistant
  markdown (headings, bold/italic, inline code, ``` fences with borders,
  `│ ` quotes, lists, box-drawing tables, OSC 8 links); italic gray thinking
  blocks (collapse with `ctrl+t`); tool calls as background-tinted boxes
  (pending → success green tint / error red tint) with a bold title
  (`read <path>`, `$ command`), preview capped at 10 lines, and
  `... (ctrl+o to expand)` reading the full result from
  `sessions/<id>/tool_calls/`.
- **Status**: braille spinner `⠋⠙⠹...` at 80 ms with a live status line naming
  the current step while a turn runs - verb plus target plus elapsed counter
  (`Reading README.md · 12s`, `Running npm test · 3s`, `Thinking… · 2s`,
  `Responding`; `Running subagent reviewer · 40s` while a `spawn_agent` call
  is in flight). A plain wait escalates with time: `Waiting for the model` →
  `The model is taking longer than usual` (15 s) → `Still no response from the
  server` (60 s). While a permission or question modal is open the line shows
  `Waiting for your approval` / `Waiting for your answer` with **no** counter
  (nothing is running), and after approval it returns to the gated tool with a
  restarted counter. Phrase table lives in `external/cli/status.go` (Go twin of
  the SPA's `liveStatus.ts`).
- **Plan widget**: current todo entries (`✓` done, `◐` active, `○` pending,
  `✗` failed) above the editor.
- **Editor**: multi-line input between full-width `─` rules (green while the
  buffer holds a `!!` command); wrap-aware
  cursor movement with sticky column; prompt history (up/down at edges, cap
  100); large pastes collapse into `[paste #N +K lines]` markers; scrolled
  content shows `─── ↑ N more ───` borders. Autocomplete: `/` commands on the
  first line, `@` file mentions (workspace walk capped at 50k entries;
  hidden directories, `node_modules`, and `.coddy` are skipped), `tab` forces file completion.
  A mention may narrow a file to a 1-based inclusive line range, `@Dockerfile:21-31`:
  the prompt is hydrated by the same `HydratePromptContentBlocks` path as ACP, so only
  those lines reach the model (see `docs/surfaces/web-ui.md`, **Line ranges**).
- **Footer**: dim `cwd (git-branch) • title [• plan]`, then
  `↑in ↓out  N.N%/ctx (auto)` left and `(provider) model [• reasoning]` right.
  A third line appears while the active model's provider reports account
  usage (today: `neuraldeep`, read from the hub's `GET /v1/limits`):
  `Pro • 3h 3% (resets 20:59) • week 7% (resets Mon 03:00) • wallet -1 229 ₽`,
  the plan, each metered window as percent **used** with its reset time in
  your clock (time of day within 24 h, weekday within a week, date beyond),
  the day window only when it is above zero, and the account's own ruble
  balance for wallet keys. A window at 80 % or more turns to the warning
  colour and a transcript notice says `You've used 82% of your NeuralDeep 3h
  limit · resets 20:59`, once per window and period; a hit limit replaces the
  windows with `limit reached (resets 20:59)` in the error colour (`rate
  limited (retry in 42s)` for a per-minute block, `key blocked`, `wallet
  empty` or `account blocked` for the ones no clock lifts) and posts `Usage
  limit reached` once. With `agent.wait_for_limit_reset` on, a turn that
  hits a limit the retries could never cover (a `429` naming a reset far
  ahead) waits for it instead of failing: the live status row reads `Usage
  limit reached · resuming at 20:59` without a running counter, the footer
  keeps the hub's numbers, and the same call runs again when the limit
  lifts (Esc stops the wait like any turn). A model on the provider's unlimited option (Qwen ∞)
  reads `∞ volume`. A rejected key reads `neuraldeep: key rejected, run
  coddy providers login neuraldeep`; when the hub cannot be reached the last
  numbers stay with `(stale)`. On narrow terminals the wallet, the day, the
  week and the plan leave in that order. The numbers arrive from the session
  manager at session start and after every turn (`provider_usage` update,
  same on `--remote`); after `/model` the console asks its backend for the
  numbers of the new provider (from the cache when warm), once a window's
  reset passes it asks for a fresh read, and when the backend deferred a
  refresh by its pacing floor the console reads the cache again when the
  answer says so. Nothing polls otherwise. `usage_limits_panel: false` on
  the provider row switches the panel off: the line stays hidden, `/usage`
  says so, and no request goes to the hub for that row; a configuration
  reload re-reads the cache, so a switched panel follows without a restart.
  Design record: `docs/plans/neuraldeep-usage.md`.

Rendering is pi's inline main-screen model: line-diff against the previous
frame, synchronized output (`ESC[?2026h/l`), per-line SGR + OSC 8 reset, a
zero-width APC cursor marker for IME hardware-cursor placement, 16 ms render
throttle with immediate renders after keystrokes.

## Commands and keys

Slash commands: client-side `/model`, `/mode`, `/resume`, `/new`, `/theme`,
`/hotkeys`, `/quit`; server-driven `/compact`, `/export`, `/plugin`, and every
loaded skill (from the ACP available-commands catalog). Enter on a slash
suggestion applies and submits in one stroke. `/export [md|html|json|jsonl]
[path]` writes the transcript into the workspace (`docs/features/session-export.md`);
under `--remote` the file lands on the server. `/usage` forces a fresh read
of the active provider's account usage (on a row whose panel is switched
off it names the `usage_limits_panel` switch instead) and prints the
breakdown as a dim block: every window with a ten-cell bar, its percent, counters and reset
time, the live requests-per-minute, the cooldown, the wallet with the last
30 days of spend, a `refresh in Ns (pacing)` line when the hub's pacing
floor deferred the read, and the snapshot's age. Under `--remote` the
server's own key is read, so a `key rejected` line there is informational
(sign in on the server).

Agent self-configuration works as it does over ACP and HTTP: every turn
offers the staged config tools (`config_get`, `config_set`,
`config_changes`, `config_commit`, `config_revert`, `config_rollback`; see
**Agent self-configuration** in `docs/reference/config.md`), and a commit or
rollback hot-reloads the running console, so the model catalog (`ctrl+l`,
`ctrl+p`), the footer, and the header's `[Context]`, `[Skills]`, `[Rules]`,
and `[MCP]` sections follow the new file without a restart. `-p/--prompt`
offers the same tools; under `--remote` the server owns the reload.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| enter | send |
| shift+enter / ctrl+j | newline (backslash+enter also splits) |
| escape | interrupt the running turn (`HandleSessionCancel`), or stop a `!!` command |
| ctrl+c | clear editor; twice within 2 s exits |
| ctrl+d | exit when the editor is empty |
| ctrl+l | model selector |
| ctrl+p / ctrl+shift+p | cycle configured models |
| shift+tab | cycle reasoning level (models with `reasoning_levels`) |
| ctrl+o | expand header hints + last tool output + last `!!` block |
| ctrl+t | collapse/expand thinking blocks |
| up / down | history at the first/last line; cursor movement otherwise |

## Local shell (`!!`)

A submitted line that starts with `!!` is not a prompt. Coddy runs the rest of
it in the workspace with the shell `run_command` uses, and neither the command
nor its output is shown to the model, persisted in the session bundle, or
counted against the context window. This is pi's bash-mode prefix; pi's other
half, `!`, which feeds the output back to the model, is still deferred.

- the prefix counts at the start of the submitted line only; while the buffer
  holds a command the editor rules turn green. To send a prompt that really
  starts with `!!`, escape it once: `\!!careful` reaches the model as
  `!!careful`;
- output streams into its own transcript block: the last 10 lines while
  collapsed, the whole capture on `ctrl+o`, and a closing `exit N` when the
  command failed. Output is decoded and stripped of control sequences exactly
  like tool output, and only the last 256 KiB is kept (the block says how much
  it dropped), so a `tail -f` neither grows the console nor slows it down;
- there is no permission modal, and `ask` / `accept_edits` / `bypass` do not
  apply: the operator who typed the command is the principal, not the model.
  Plan mode restricts the agent's tools, not the terminal in front of you;
- `escape` kills the running command and the process group it leads, and so
  does quitting the console, so nothing keeps printing into the terminal coddy
  just gave back. Work the command deliberately detaches (`cmd &`, `nohup`)
  outlives it exactly as in your own shell: once the command itself exits the
  console has nothing left to stop. A second `escape` gives the console back
  when a kill cannot reap its target at all. There is no timeout and no
  adoption into the background task pool - that pool is agent-visible on
  purpose;
- one at a time: a `!!` line is refused while a turn runs, and while a command
  runs the console refuses prompts, another `!!`, and every modal (`/new`,
  `/resume`, `/mode`, `/theme`, `ctrl+l`), each with a status line saying so -
  none of them queue. A modal would swallow `escape`, which is the only key
  that stops the command;
- the command reads from the null device, not from the terminal: an
  interactive program (`!!python`) sees EOF instead of stealing keystrokes
  from the editor;
- `--remote` refuses it. The session workspace lives on the server, so running
  the command on this machine would silently touch a different tree;
- `-p/--prompt` does not interpret the prefix: a one-shot prompt goes to the
  model verbatim.

The block belongs to the running console only. Reopening the session with
`-c`, `--session-id`, or `/resume` does not replay it, because nothing about a
`!!` command is written to disk.

Modals replace the editor while open: permission requests (the option list
comes from the agent's `permission.Options`), the question tool (single or
multi-select via space, custom free-text answers), model/mode/theme/session
selectors (`→ ` cursor, type-to-filter, `(i/n)` scroll indicator).

The question modal spends every row on its option label and prints the
description of the highlighted option under the list, word-wrapped over the
whole width, so a sentence-long answer stays readable instead of being cut at
a column boundary. When the question is answered, its tool block shows the
questions with the chosen answers (`→ answer`, `→ (no answer)` for a dismissed
one) rather than the JSON the tool hands the model.

## Flags

`--config --home --cwd --sessions-dir` mirror the other subcommands.
`-t/--test-config` checks the config file the console would load against the
schema and the loader's rules, prints each problem with its line and how to fix
it, and exits with status 1 on errors (see
[config.md](../getting-started/configuration.md#checking-the-file-from-the-command-line)); it works in
lean builds without the `cli` tag as well. `--dry-run` goes one step further:
after that check it probes what the file points at - the directories it
names, every provider's model list (address and credential in one request),
the MCP commands, the Telegram token, the `--remote` target when one is
given - and exits with status 1 when a probe fails. Alone it prints only the
problems and a status line; together with `--test-config` it prints the config
check report and every probe (see
[config.md](../getting-started/configuration.md#dry-run-probing-what-the-file-points-at)).
`--session-id <id>` reopens (or creates) that session and replays its
transcript. `-c/--continue` reopens the most recent session recorded for this
folder (errors when none exists; mutually exclusive with `--session-id` and
`--resume`). `--resume` opens the session picker first and creates nothing
until you choose (mutually exclusive with `--session-id`; `--model`,
`--mode`, and `--permission-mode` apply to whichever session the picker
selects). `--model`, `--mode agent|plan|ask`, and
`--permission-mode ask|accept_edits|bypass` apply through the validated
manager config-option API before the UI starts, in every launch mode
(interactive, `--continue`, `--resume`, and `--prompt`). `--theme
dark|light|auto` (auto falls back COLORFGBG → dark). `--plain` disables
terminal queries, modifyOtherKeys, titles, and OSC 8 for deterministic
automation. Logging is forced away from the terminal into
`<home>/logs/cli.log` (`--log-file`, `--log-level`). `--log-level` takes a
bare level or a comma-separated spec that raises one subsystem on its own,
for example `--log-level "info,agent=debug"` (see
[config-reference.md](../reference/config.md#logger)).

## One-shot print mode (`-p/--prompt`)

`coddy -p "..."` (or `coddy cli --prompt "..."`) runs a single agent turn
without a terminal: assistant text streams to stdout, diagnostics go to
stderr, and the process exits non-zero on errors or a cancelled turn. No tty
is required, so it fits scripts and cron. The turn persists as a normal
session, and `-c -p "..."` continues it — tokens, files, and tool state
carry over exactly like the interactive console. Permission requests resolve
non-interactively: `bypass` allows, anything else rejects the call with a
note on stderr. The question tool returns empty answers. `--model`, `--mode`,
`--permission-mode`, `--session-id`, and `--continue` all combine with
`--prompt`; `--resume` does not (it needs the interactive picker).

## Remote mode (`--remote`)

`--remote <target>` points the console (interactive and `-p` print runs) at a
remote `coddy serve` server instead of running the agent in-process. The
target is a configured remote name (`httpserver.remotes`), a bare
`host:port` (scheme defaults to http), or a full http(s) URL. The bearer
token comes from `--remote-token` or `CODDY_REMOTE_TOKEN`; tokens are
deliberately never read from config.yaml. The same pair of flags works on
`coddy acp`, so an ACP editor can drive a remote coddy too.

Remotely, turns execute on the server in its workspace: the transcript, tool
boxes, thinking, plan updates, token and context stats stream back over SSE;
permission and question modals answer through the server's REST endpoints;
`ctrl+o` fetches full tool output from the server. The model selector lists
the remote catalog (`GET /v1/models`), `/mode` picks the agent, plan, or ask
profile per turn, and `/resume`, `-c`, and `--session-id` operate on the
server's session list (the local folder filter does not apply). The
permission mode is governed by the remote server's configuration:
`--permission-mode` and the `/permissions` option are rejected with a clear
error. Reasoning-level cycling is unavailable remotely in v1. Sessions
persist only on the server; the startup banner shows `remote: <url>` and the
exit hint prints a reconnect command with `--remote` included.

Subagents run on the remote host: the definitions, the trust receipts and the
child sessions are the server's. Approve a project definition there (`coddy
agents trust` on the server, or `POST /coddy/subagents/{name}/trust`); the
local `coddy agents` subcommands do not take `--remote`. A child's permission
prompts reach the remote console like the parent's own, prefixed
`[subagent <name>]`, and the status line reads `Running subagent <name>` while
the child runs. The footer shows the local folder; the trust receipt is keyed
by the server-side session workspace (the server's default cwd for a session
the console created). A dropped connection leaves the server turn and its
child running; `/resume` shows the outcome once it ends, and an answer to a
prompt the server has already withdrawn is ignored. Quitting the console
mid-turn waits briefly for the remote cancel to reach the server. See
`docs/features/subagents.md`, Remote mode.

## Subagent definitions (`coddy agents`)

Three subcommands manage the subagent definitions the agent may delegate to
(`docs/features/subagents.md`). They need no build tag, like `coddy mcp` and
`coddy rules`:

```
coddy agents list [--cwd DIR]
coddy agents trust <name> [--cwd DIR]
coddy agents untrust <name> [--cwd DIR]
```

`list` prints the workspace and the effective `subagents.project_trust`, then
the catalog as a table with `NAME`, `SCOPE` (`builtin`, `user`, `project`),
`TRUST` (`trusted` or `needs_approval`), `FLAGS` (`hidden`, `model=…`,
`mode=…`), `DESCRIPTION` and `PATH` (`(embedded)` for built-ins), a `(total N)`
line, and a hint when project definitions await approval. `trust` prints the
effective declaration first (file, model, mode, permission mode, tool lists,
digest, receipt path) and then records a receipt for the file as it is on disk
right now, keyed by the canonical workspace, the name and the file digest, in
`<home>/subagents-trust.json`; a built-in or user-scope name needs no approval
and the command says so. `untrust` withdraws a receipt. `--cwd` defaults to the
process working directory, resolved like `coddy mcp`. Under
`subagents.project_trust: deny` project files are not listed at all, and under
`allow` they need no receipt.

In the console a `spawn_agent` call shows as a tool box like any other, and the
status line reads `Running subagent <name>` with its elapsed counter for as long
as the child runs. A child's permission request, while its spawning turn is
still alive, opens the usual modal in the parent chat with the title prefixed
`[subagent <name>]`. Child sessions (`sub_…` ids) are read-only transcripts:
`-c` never picks one, and a prompt sent to one is refused with a message naming
the parent session.

## Hook definition files (`coddy hooks`)

Three subcommands manage the hook definition files a session would load
(`docs/features/hooks.md`). They need no build tag, like `coddy agents`:

```
coddy hooks list [--cwd DIR]
coddy hooks trust <file> [--cwd DIR]
coddy hooks untrust <file> [--cwd DIR]
```

`list` prints the workspace and the effective `hooks.project_trust`, then a
table with `FILE` (the name receipts use: the workspace-relative path for a
project file, the absolute path for the operator's own), `SCOPE` (`user`,
`project`), `TRUST` (`trusted` or `needs_approval`) and `HOOKS` (a summary such
as `PreToolUse(run_command); PostToolUse(*)`, or `invalid: <error>` for a file
that does not parse), a `(total N)` line, and a hint when project files await
approval. `trust` prints the hooks it is about to approve (event, matcher,
command) and records a receipt for the file as it is on disk right now, keyed
by the canonical workspace, the file and its digest, in
`<home>/hooks-trust.json`; a user-scope file needs no approval and the command
says so, and an invalid file is refused. `untrust` withdraws a receipt. `--cwd`
defaults to the process working directory, resolved like `coddy mcp`. Under
`hooks.project_trust: deny` project files are not listed at all, and under
`allow` they need no receipt. A remote console (`--remote`) approves through
`POST /coddy/hooks/trust` on the server instead, because the receipt must live
on the machine running the hooks.

## Security

All text from outside the renderer — model output, tool previews, titles,
file names, skill and MCP names — is sanitized before display: ESC, C0
controls (except newline and tab), DEL, and C1 controls are stripped, so
model- or tool-supplied escape sequences can never reach the terminal. The
only control sequences in rendered lines are renderer-generated styling.

Permission mode `ask` renders every request as a modal; `bypass` short-circuits
exactly like the ACP `serverRef` path. The `!!` prefix has no permission gate
by design (see **Local shell**): it can only be reached from a submitted
editor buffer, never from model output, so nothing the model writes can start
a command through it. Project-local MCP servers still go
through the workspace trust gate; a server pending approval stays disconnected
and is visible via `coddy mcp list` (approve with `coddy mcp trust <name>`).

Two capture sets exist, and they answer different questions.

`docs/assets/screenshot-console-*.png` are photographs of the running console
in a real **Konsole** window (1920 px wide, cropped to the used rows): the
launch line and header with `[Context]` / `[Skills]`
(`screenshot-console-start.png`), the `ctrl+l` model selector
(`screenshot-console-models.png`), and a finished turn with a tool box, a
thinking block, and the footer counters (`screenshot-console-chat.png`). Use
these in README and on the site: they show what a user actually sees in a
terminal emulator.

`docs/assets/cli-tui/` is the deterministic set produced by
`examples/cli/capture.py`, which drives the shared e2e driver and renders each
state from the pyte buffer as `.txt`, styled `.html`, and `.png`. Those are
regression references for colors and cell layout, not marketing images;
regenerate them when the transcript chrome changes. The four usage states
(`09-usage-footer`, `10-usage-warning`, `12-usage-resuming`,
`11-usage-blocked`) come from `examples/cli/capture_usage.py`, which stands
a fake hub `GET /limits` behind `CODDY_NEURALDEEP_BASE_URL`, plus one chat
completion that answers a `429` naming a reset far ahead for the waiting
turn, so no real key is needed; only their PNGs are kept.

`docs/assets/pi-tui-reference/` holds captures of the pi original for
comparison, as described under **Visual model**.

## Testing

- Unit + BDD: `go test -tags=cli ./...`; the happy-path spec is
  `features/cli_tui.feature` run by `external/cli/bdd_cli_tui_test.go`
  (stub runner, fake terminal — no LLM, no pty). The provider usage
  scenarios stand a fake hub `GET /limits` behind
  `CODDY_NEURALDEEP_BASE_URL` (process-wide, so the package stays
  sequential) and drive the manager's pacing clock with
  `SetProviderUsageClock`; `external/cli/usage_test.go` pins the footer
  wording, the drop order, the blocker copy, the sanitising of hub strings
  and the reset timer.
- Real pty, no model: `examples/cli/cli_e2e_startup.py` opens the built
  binary in a pty (pexpect + pyte), waits for the first frame, types into the
  editor, clears it with ctrl+c and exits with the second one, then checks the
  resume hint and the exit status. CI runs it in the `cli` job of the Linux test
  matrix and on `macos-latest` (job `test-macos`, which also runs the platform packages and
  the console suite on macOS), because the Go suite never opens a pty and the
  console's terminal path is exactly what differs between hosts.
- Live e2e: `./examples/test_cli.sh` drives the real binary in a pty
  (pexpect + pyte, Linux-only) against `neuraldeep/qwen3.8-27b` by default —
  see `examples/README.md`.

## Known v1 divergences from pi

Undo/yank-pop and jump-mode in the editor, kitty keyboard protocol
negotiation, inline images, pi's `!` bash mode (the half that feeds command
output back to the model: `!!` ships as described under **Local shell**, while
`!` needs a model-visible transcript record and stays deferred), pi's
`/settings` surface, and the session picker's scope/sort/rename controls. Theme switching rebuilds chrome; already-rendered transcript rows
keep their colors until the next session.
